# Features:

* My script has several features which I wanted :
* Daemonised - has a daemon base class that allows POSIX standard Daemon (start|stop|restart|status)
* Single location for Config
* More unified code - a more coherent method for displaying the icon file - rather than having two scripts communicating via an open
* Rather than toggling the icon I've got it stet up on a timer - but will be configurable to be a toggle 
* As the value changes and it cycles through the percent range it will display the icon i.e. if it was 75% and it drops to 50% the indicator will display the 50% icon

# Compatible Components:

* ADS1015
* ADS1115
* Camble's SafeShutdown Bangood and Powerboost Version (comming soon)
